### What is this?
A project that helps us learn how to run and test postman calls using the postman desktop app. 

### Setup
- `cd` into the `postman-testing` directory
- `npm i` to install neccessary dependencies
- Go to the Postman app, `import` in the top left corner > select the file inside of `endpoint_testing.json` from the `postman-testing` folder
- `nodemon` in the terminal to get the server up

### To start testing:
- click on the first request in the collection `GET - All Students` and click the blue `Send` in the upper righthand corner
- make sure you're receiving data in the `Body` below
- then, click on the `Tests` tab under the request URL. This is where the Postman requests go.
