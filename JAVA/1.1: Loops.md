+ ‘for’ — loops through a block of code a number of times
    * syntax: for ( setup; condition; change ) {}
        - "setup": where are you starting? this runs before anything else in our function
        - "condition": where does your loop end? this if often designated when the array reaches its end (arr.length)
        - "change": what do you want done when your loop finishes? this is often designated as i++ or i-- for incremental/decremental loops 
    * For example
            var myArr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
            var total = 0;
            for (var i=0; i<myArr.length; i++) {
                total += myArr[i];
            };

            - 1: Declare and initialize your variables 
            - 2: Use the key word: for() {}

+ ‘for/in’ — loops through the properties of an object
    * do not use to loop through arrays where index order is important; use ‘for’ instead   
    * For example
            var drink = {
                    Color: ‘orange’,
                    taste: ‘orange’,
                    carbonated: true,
                    brand: ‘sunkisser’
                }
                for (var key in drink) {
                    var value = drink[key];
                    if(value === ‘orange’){
                        drink[key] = ‘cherry’;
                    }
                }

        - 1: Use the for key word: for() {}
        - 2: Use in the in keyword to indicate they are a different kind of for loop: for(... in ...) {}
        - 3: Need a variable to the left of the in: for(var key in ...) {}
        - 4: Place the object you are looping over to the right of the in: for(var key in object){}
        - 5: Are used to loop over all of the keys of an object:
                    var obj = {
                        x: 7,
                        y: 2,
                        z: 2
                    };

                    for(var key in obj){
                        key === x / y / z
                    };
        - 6: Commonly paired with square bracket notation to access the object:
                    for(var key in obj){
                        var value = obj[key]; //key is a string representing each object 1 at a time
                        obj[key] = newValue; //square bracket is also used to assign
                    }

+ ‘while’ — loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
+ ‘do/while’ — loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true
