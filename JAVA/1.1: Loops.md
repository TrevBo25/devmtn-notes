+ ‘for’ — loops through a block of code a number of times
+ ‘for/in’ — loops through the properties of an object
* do not use to loop through arrays where index order is important; use ‘for’ instead

* For example
    var drink = {
            Color: ‘orange’,
            taste: ‘orange’,
            carbonated: true,
            brand: ‘sunkisser’
        }
        for (var key in drink) {
            var value = drink[key];
            if(value === ‘orange’){
                drink[key] = ‘cherry’;
            }
        }

    - 1: Use the for key word: for() {}
    - 2: Use in the in keyword to indicate they are a different kind of for loop: for(... in ...) {}
    - 3: Need a variable to the left of the in: for(var key in ...) {}
    - 4: Place the object you are looping over to the right of the in: for(var key in object){}
    - 5: Are used to loop over all of the keys of an object:
            var obj = {
                x: 7,
                y: 2,
                z: 2
            };

            for(var key in obj){
                key === x / y / z
            };
    - 6: Commonly paired with square bracket notation to access the object:
            for(var key in obj){
                var value = obj[key]; //key is a string representing each object 1 at a time
                obj[key] = newValue; //square bracket is also used to assign
            }

+ ‘while’ — loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
+ ‘do/while’ — loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true
