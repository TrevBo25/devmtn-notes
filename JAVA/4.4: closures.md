### CLOSURES

## What are they?
- An integral component of asynchronous architecture 
- Frequently used in node.js or JQuery

## What do they do?
- Help us keep our data secure
    + For example: You have to go through a teller at your bank to deposit or withdraw from your account. Similarly, you have to go through the closure to affect change on your function. 
- Help us remember things when using callbacks (local vs global scope)
    + This is what allows for asynchronous functionality 
- Get rid of unused code when we're done running it, which is why callbacks are so key

## What do they look like?
- A function within a function
    + This means they have access to the enclosing (outer) func's variables in addition to the inner's
    + 3 total scopes available to a closure: its own, outer func's, all globals

    function showName(firstName, lastName) {
        var nameIntro = "your name is ";
        function makeFullName() {
            return nameInto + firstName + " " + lastName;
        }
        return makeFullName();      <-- this is the closure!!!!!!!! 
    }

# RULES:
1) Closures have access to the other func's variable even after the outer function returns
    - This means we can call the inner func later
2) They store references to the outer func's variables without storing their actual value 
    For example...
        function celebrityID() {
            var celebrityID = 999;
            return {
                getID: function() {
                    return celebrityID;
                },
                setID: function(newID) {
                    celebrityID = newID;
                };
            }
        }

        var mjID = celebrityID();   <- calls outer func
        mjID.getID();               <- returns 999
        mjID.setID(567);            <- affects change on outer func's variable
        mjID.getID();               <- returns the new ID value of 567
