# underscore! 
# underscorejs.org
+ exploring a common library
+ array methods like forEach, map, filter all got their start in the underscorejs library
    - npm i --save underscore
    - app.js > import _ from 'underscore';

## pluck
- convenient means to extrack a list of property values (common-use case for map)
- _.pluck(list, propertyName)
- returns the values in an array

## union
- computes the union of passed-in arrays, in order, that are present in one or more of the arrays 
- _.union(*arrays)

## intersection
- essentially the opposite of union, displays all that appear in both
- returns all shared values to a new array
- _.intersection(*arrays)

## groupBy
- splits a collection into sets, grouped by the result of running each value through iteratee
- if iteratee is a string instead ofa function, groups by the prop named by iteratee on each of the values 
- returns an object

## mapObject
- _.mapObject(object, iteratee, [context])
- like map, but for objects
- better than a 'for/in' loop
- returns val/key variables 

## memoize 
- allows us to cache the computed result of a function for later use
- useful for speeding up slow-running computations 
- the cache of memoized values is available as the cache property on the returned function
- _.memoize(function, [hashFunction])
    + if passed an option hashFunction, it will be used to compute the hash key for storing the result
    + this is based on arguments to the original function
    + default hashFunction uses first argument to the memoized function as the key
