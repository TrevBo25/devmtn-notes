## Objects Practice

### Objective
- To better understand objects in Javascript by completing a series of activities

### Problem #1
1. Create an object called me. Give it a key of `name` with the value being your name, and another key of `age` with the value being your age. Then `alert` your name using dot notation.
```
```


2. Make a `favoriteThings` object that contains the following keys: `band`, `food`, `person`, `book`, `movie`, `holiday`. Have the values to those keys be your favorite thing in that category.
```
```


3. After you've made your object, add another key named `car` with the value being your favorite car and then another key named `brand` with the value being your favorite brand.
```
```


4. Now change the value of the `food` key in your `favoriteThings` object to be `'Chicken Nuggets'` and change the value of the `book` key in your `favoriteThings` object to be `'Harry Potter'`.
```
```



### Problem #2
1. Create an empty Object called `backPack`. 
```
```


2. Now, create a variable called `item` and set it equal to the string `firstPocket`. 
```
```


3. Using bracket notation, add a `firstPocket` key (or property) to `backPack`, using `item`.
```
```


4. Set the value of that key to `chapstick`.
```
```


5. Using dot notation, add another key (or property) to your `backPack` object that is named `color`, with the value being the color of your backpack. 
```
```


6. After you do the above, `alert` your entire `backPack `object.
```
```
 


### Problem #3
  ```
    var user2 = {
            name: 'Ty',
            age: 24,
            pwHash: 'U+Ldlngx2BYQk',
            email: 'ty33@gmail.com',
            birthday: '05/02/1990',
            username: 'tylermcginnis33'
    };
  ```

1. Let's say I, the user, decided to change my `name` and `email` address to the following `name` -> `Tyler S. McGinnis`, `email` -> `tyler.mcginnis@devmounta.in`. How would I do that?
```
```

## ðŸš¨ BONUS ROUND ðŸš¨

### Bonus #1
1. Create an empty object called `methodCollection`.
```
```


2. Now add two methods (functions that are properties on objects) to your methodCollection object. One called `alertHello` which alerts `'hello'` and another method called `logHello` which logs `'hello'` to the console. 
```
```


3. Now call your `alertHello` and `logHello` methods.
```
```



### Bonus #2
1. Create a function called `makePerson` which takes in `name`, `birthday`, and `ssn` as its parameters and returns a new object with all of the information that you passed in.
```
```



### Bonus #3
1. Create a function called `makeCard` which takes in `cardNumber`, `expirationDate`, and `securityCode` to make a `CreditCard` object and returns that object so that whenever you invoke `makeCard`, you get a brand new credit card.
```
```
