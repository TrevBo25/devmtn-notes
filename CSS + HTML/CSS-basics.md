## CSS Specificity
- Which styles apply when there is a conflict?
- Specificity is a set of rules that decide which style should dominate: a scale
    
    Specificity | Points | Example
    ----------- | ------ | -------
    Most specific | 1000 pts. | inline styling
    Moderately specific | 100 pts. | id
    Less specific | 10 pts. | class, pseudo-class, attribute
    Least specific | 1 pt. | elements
