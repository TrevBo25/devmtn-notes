### EXPRESS SESSIONS ###

# Todd's Focus Questions:
* Why would we want to use sessions?
* What is a cookie
* Is the session unique to each computer or login?

# Tyler's Class Notes:
## What is middleware?
- Code that sits in the middle of two other pieces of code 
- Is able to monitor and possibly modify communication, in both directions 
- All middleware takes a req, res, next
- Gives us a chance to modify requests

## When do we use app.use() vs inline middleware?
- inline middleware: when we insert middleware as a parameter, when we want it to run for just a single route/endpoint
- app.use(): runs the middleware for every single request to our server, which can be desireable (i.e. body-parser)

## What is the 'next' parameter in a middleware function? What makes it useful, say, compared to if you were expect to use a return statement?
- The next paramter is called only when our middleware is done
- Allows us to do async operations, like looking up data within a db, or making a request to another server

## What's an HTTP session?
- An on-going conversation between client and server
