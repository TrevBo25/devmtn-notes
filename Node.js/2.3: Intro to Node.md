# Getting started with Node

## Todd's Focus Questions:
- _What do we use NPM for?_
- _How are package.json files useful?_
- _What is a client? What is a server? Explain the data flow between them._
- _In the simplest terms, what does Node allow us to do?_
- _What is an Endpoint?_
- _What is a URL Parameter?_

## What is npm? 
- npm comes from node modules, so no ‘./‘ necessary as prefix
- N ode 
    P ackage 
        M anager
- commonly used tool on the command line

- npm install : 
    - installs to ‘node_modules’ folder. Accessed when we import React
    - you can install multiple packages in the same command
    - to make sure we can access these files later, --save [folder name] 
        + (opens package.JSON and adds folders to dependencies so that we don’t have to upload & save to GitHub each time)    
    - .gitignore — a file where you list anything you want GitHub to ignore — must be created before you git commit
    - -g: creates a global tool (to be used on the command line) for your create-react-app, live-server, etc.

- package.JSON :
    - file helps remember important information without publishing the individual elements to GitHub
                
- yarn :
    - takes less time to install  
    - includes both npm and bower
    - yarn install (equivalence to npm install)

## Working with node.js...
+ instead of 
    import { this }  from ‘destination’ 
    ... or ...
    const this = ‘destination' 
    ... we use ...
    var this = require(‘destination’)
+ this is because of legacy code

req.body === res.data
