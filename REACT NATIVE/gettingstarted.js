// SETUP IS KEY! IF YOU DO IT WRONG YOU CANNOT CHECKOUT YOUR APP

// Balsamic Mockups 3

// xCode: packages our code and the React Native library into an installable app and run it on the iOS simulator
// HomeBrew: used to install node and watchman
// Node/NPM: runs JavaScript outside of the browser. Node and NPM come together
    // Node Package Manager - NPM is used to installing and managing dependencies
// watchman: watches files on the hard drive and waits for them to change
// RN CLI: React Native Command Line Interface: used to generate new React Native projects 

// index.android.js and index.ios.js are essential root files 
    // considered "entry points" to our app
