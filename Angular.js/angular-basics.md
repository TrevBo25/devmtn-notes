# Get to know Angular! 

## Some background:
- [jQuery Docs](jQuery.com)
- putting jQuery into your docs:
    - [code.jQuery.com](code.jQuery.com)
    - pick a version, select a format (`uncompressed` is recommended)
    - insert the block of code in a `<script>` tag at the top of your code 
- the grandfather of a number of ES6/ES7 JavaScript functions (for example: `map()`)
- Angular 1 is the most commonly implementing version of this framework in the marketplace

## Keywords:
- `directive`: An HTML attribute or tag that gives behavior to the element
- `CDN`: **C**ontent **D**elivery **N**etwork
    - how files are commonly distributed for Angular apps (and others that are not bundled)
- `module`: A reusable code section that is used elsewhere in the app
    - similarly to React
- `dependency injection`: A way to swap out dependencies for the sake of testing and othe developer concerns
    - Used when declaring dependencies for module definitions and controller functions
