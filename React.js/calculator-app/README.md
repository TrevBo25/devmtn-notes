## What does this project accomplish?
- Using create-react-app, I made a calculator interface to handle onClick and onChange events
- I learned how to:
    - import/export components
    - install and implement npm create-react-app
    - handle changes in state
    - use proper JSX syntax
    - handle onClick and onChange events

## To view on your own browser:
- `cd` into `React.js/calculator-app`
- `npm i --save`
- `npm start`
