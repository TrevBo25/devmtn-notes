## Todd's Focus Questions:
* What Is a foreign key?
    - How we relate our tables to each other
* What does an Inner Join do?
    - Joins tables we've designated by their common rows using foreign keys
* What does Aliasing allow you to do?
    - Shorten your vars in an SQL request using 'AS'
    - For example... FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
        would allow us to use WHERE c.id = o.c_id; 
* What character does the Like keyword replace when using Where?
    - %
* What keyword is used for doing a sub query?
    - IN

## MANIPULATIONS
- Gathering data about our data
- Some examples...
    + return total # of names in cities instead of data within the "name"
        SELECT COUNT (name)
        FROM cities;
    + return independent values and eliminate all duplicates
        SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT name)
        FROM cities;
    + return the single oldest city in the table
        SELECT MIN(founded), name
        FROM cities;
    + return the average city population in our table -- does the math for us
        SELECT avg(Population)
        FROM cities;

# ALTERING TABLES
- How do we alter tables without affecting their values?
    ALTER TABLE Scores
    ADD COLUMN scoreID
    ADD INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
    ADD FOREIGN KEY this REFERENCES that table
* All newly added columns and rows are empty by default 
- Changing existing data types:
    ALTER DATA Grades
    ALTER grade
    SET DATA TYPE decimal;
        + this example would change our letter grades to number grades in a table 
- Renaming columns:
    ALTER TABLE Grades
    RENAME COLUMN student_name
    TO student_full_name;
        + this would change student_name from maybe a single var to the full name, including first last and middle 
- Removing columns:
    ALTER TABLE employees
    DROP COLUMN bonus;
        + this example would eliminate the column of bonus data in our employee db
- Renaming tables:
    ALTER TABLE employees
    RENAME TO underlings;

## FOREIGN KEYS
- How we relate our tables to each other
- Must REFERENCES a primary key in another table
    CREATE TABLE Test (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(50), 
        subject_id INTEGER REFERENCES users_id
    );

## JOINS
- Allow us to join tables together that already utilize foreign keys
- Inner join: selects only rows where there is a match
  For example...
        SELECT *
        FROM citites
        INNER JOIN cities ON cities.stateID = states.id;
- Outer join: joins all rows, with or without a match
    + LEFT (first), RIGHT (second), or FULL (both)

## FILTER / ORDER BY / LIMIT
- Options to organize and filter our results
    * DISTINCT: finds duplicates and eliminates them
    * ORDER BY: sorts data given a column name in ASC or DESC order
    * LIMIT: we determine the number of results we would like
        + important to use ORDER BY in addition to LIMIT when we want particular values (i.e. 1-10, 10-20)
    * GROUP BY / HAVING

## PARTIAL MATCHES
- Using LIKE we can use wildcard symbols to make our searches more flexible
    + '%m' -- will return matches that end in 'm'
    + '%m%' -- will return matches that contain 'm' 
    + 'm%' -- will return matches that begin with 'm'
    + T_is -- returns all values that successfully fill in the blank

## ALIASES
- Sometimes we don't want to type the full var name in longer requests
- Aliases allow us to shorten our SQL query 
  For example...
    SELECT c.name, c.email, o.id, o.total
    FROM customers AS c, orders AS o
    WHERE c.id = o.c_id

## SUBQUERIES 
- We can be even more specific in our requests using subqueries 
        SELECT name
        FROM cities
        WHERE state_id IN (3, 4)
        WHERE statehood > 1800;
            + this should return exactly 2 city names
