## Three Stages in Git:
1) untracked - not available to be pushed up to Git
2) staged - unsafe position to leave your code in
3) committed - unlikely to be deleted

## Git is... 
- pre-code structure
- "version control"
- a tool used to save multiple forms of the same code 
- allows us to rollback (return to OG code if something gets fucked up) and git shame others (shame!)

## Creating a Repository on Github
- Initialize a git in the root of the repo you'd like to upload
    git init
- If you have an existing git that you would like to add to, copy and paste into command line
    git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
- Now push the staged changes into github
    ```
    git add .
    git push -u origin master
    ```  
+ change 'master' to whichever branch you want to push to

## Inviting Collaborators 
- Can be done on the GitHub site instead of command line. 
- YourRepo > Settings > Collaborators

## Pushing/Committing Changes
- Set the stage for your changes:
    `git add .`
- Push the current repo up into github
    `git commit -m "you commit message here"`
- Pushing changes to a separate branch
    `git push -u origin <branch>`

## Checking Out Someone Else's Repo
- Create a local copy by copying the outside repo's HTTPS
- cd into the working directory you hope to clone into
    `git clone https://www.github.com/user/repo.git`

## Branching in Your Own Repo
- Create a new branch named "feature_x" and switch to it using
    `git checkout -b feature_x`
- Switch back to master
    `git checkout master`
- To delete the branch again
    `git branch -d feature_x`
- A branch is not available to others unless you push the branch to your remote repository
    `git push origin <branch>`
